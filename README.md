## Description
Kong Ingress Controller allows you to run `Kong Gateway` as a Kubernetes Ingress to handle inbound requests for a Kubernetes cluster.
Kong Ingress Controller takes Kubernetes resources such as `Ingress` and `HTTPRoute` and converts them into a valid Kong Gateway configuration. It enables you to use all the features of Kong Gateway.
